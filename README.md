A UiPath project that automates user testing of my Latin project The Latin project makes a call to the Wikipedia api but it is not guaranteed to have pictures. It loads the webpage of https://github.com/Dkeegan/Visual-latin - it is set to the default port numbers. This cycles through calling random chapters for a given amount of calls. Checks to see if pictures or text is returned. Writes the word, chapter, and a binary check. This also has the side effect of gameifying the program. There is a sample python script to determine the percentage of results that have pictures.

# TODO:

Checks if Pexels returns pictures
